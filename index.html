    <p>
        Hi, I like to make Origami.
It is a hobby of mine, I have been making origami since I was little. I usually do it in my free time.
    </p>
    
       <p>
I hope to make more and more creations    </p>

            <p>
                There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.
                Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
                Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.

    A panda is bigger than a teddy 
    They are good at climbing trees and can swim
    Pandas go from pink to white to black

    They are often called locusts
    They land on you if you are using a powerful tool
    cicadas have five eyes
